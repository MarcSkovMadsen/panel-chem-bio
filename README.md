# 🧪 Panel-Chemistry

The purpose of the `panel-chemistry` project is to make it really easy for you 👨‍🔬 to do **exploratory data analysis** and **build powerful data and viz tools** 📈🛠️ within the domain of **Chemistry** ⚗️ using [Python](https://www.python.org/) 🐍 and [HoloViz Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) ❤️.

## 🏁 Background

This project is just starting (2021-05-19) and not much more than an idea.

It was started by the discussion [How to display JSME molecular editor with Panel?](https://discourse.holoviz.org/t/how-to-display-jsme-molecular-editor-with-panel/2306/12) in the [Panel Community Forum](https://discourse.holoviz.org/)

## 🏃 Getting Started

ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY. NOT YET AVAILABLE.

```bash
pip install panel_chemistry
```

```python
import panel_chemistry as pc
import panel as pn

pn.extension("jsme", sizing_mode="stretch_width)

editor = pc.JSMEEditor(height=800)
editor
```
